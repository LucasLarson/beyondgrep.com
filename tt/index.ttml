        <h1 class="pkg_mgr_desc">ack is a grep-like source code search tool.</h1>

        <h2 class="pkg_mgr_desc">The latest version of ack is [% current_version %], released [% current_date %].</h2>

        <p>
        Designed for programmers with large heterogeneous
        trees of source code, ack is written in
        portable Perl 5 and takes advantage of the power of
        Perl's regular expressions.

        <h1>What's new in ack?</h1>

        <h2>New --not option</h2>
        <p>
            The new repeatable --not option lets you get more precise matches. If you want to search for "dogs" but not
            if "cats" or "fish" are on the line, use
        <p>

<pre>
ack dogs --not cats --not fish
</pre>

        <h2>Easier to understand error messages</h2>
        <p>
            The error message ack displays when the regex passed is invalid
            has been improved. The message is more readable and includes a
            pointer to the offending part of the regex. For example:
        </p>

<pre>
$ ack 'status: (open|closed|in progress'
ack: Invalid regex 'status: (open|closed|in progress'
Regex: status: (open|closed|in progress
               ^---HERE Unmatched ( in regex
</pre>

        <h2>New <tt>--proximate</tt> option groups matches near each other</h2>

        <p>
            A new option <tt>--proximate=N</tt> groups together lines of
            output that are within N lines of each other in the file.  This is
            useful when looking for matches that are related to each other.
        </p>

        <p>
            For example, these results:
        </p>

<pre>
    15: First match
    18: Second match
    19: Third match
    37: Fourth match
</pre>

        <p>
            look like this with <tt>--proximate=1</tt>.
        </p>

<pre>
    15: First match

    18: Second match
    19: Third match

    37: Fourth match
</pre>

        <h2>Improved <tt>-w</tt> option</h2>

        <p>
            The <tt>-w</tt> option, which tells ack to only find whole-word
            matches, did not always work if your pattern began or ended with
            puncutation.  ack would make guesses as to what your intent was,
            but it was not well-defined.  Now, ack disallows regexes that
            begin or end with non-word characters.
        </p>

        <p>
            This means that if you use <tt>ack -w foo:</tt>, the new ack
            will not allow it, whereas ack 2.x would.
        </p>

        <h2>Added <tt>-S</tt> as a synonym for <tt>--smart-case</tt></h2>
        <p>
            For those without <tt>--smart-case</tt> always on, the <tt>-S</tt>
            will be easier for when you do want to use it.
        </p>
        <p>
            Smart-case matching makes ack do a case-insensitive search unless
            the pattern being matched has a capital letter in it.
        </p>

        <h2>Added <tt>-I</tt> to force case-sensitivity</h2>
        <p>
            If you use <tt>--smart-case</tt> in your .ackrc, you can use
            <tt>-I</tt> to force case-sensitivity instead of having to use
            <tt>--no-smart-case</tt> (which still works).
        </p>

        <h2>Significant speed improvements</h2>
        <p>
            Run times for ack 3 compared to ack 2.22 are 30-40% faster
            because of removal of unused infrastructure for plugins.
